# 🖧 SERVER CSOL Connect
This is the server application for "**CSOL Connect**".

## What is CSOL Connect?
It is a sofware designed for **monitoring** and **mapping** desktop computers in a computer laboratory that specifically monitors the mouse, keyboard and LAN ports of a computer. If it detects that a mouse, a keyboard, or an ethernet cable was removed, it will send that data and notify the computer that has the SERVER software installed in it. Moreover, that data includes the device that has been removed, the time and date it happened, the name of the computer, and the lab that the computer belonged to. This can be used by the admin to investigate and make a report.
